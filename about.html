<p class="p-aboutus">Welcome to my store! This is a small business that specializes in selling a variety of delicious candies, with special attention to brigadeiro, a traditional Brazilian sweet. Although the store is still in a early stage, it have already made a mark in the online market by selling on Instagram since October 2021.
  The Instagram shop is a vibrant showcase of all colorful sweets that I make, where customers can browse through them and place their orders by selecting what they whant. I carefully manage my selection to offer a diverse range of candies, including classics, unique flavors, and international delights, ensuring there's something for everyone's taste buds.

From walls adorned with candy-filled jars to shelves lined with an assortment of treats, the future store will be a haven for candy lovers of all ages.
  I'm passionate about delivering exceptional customer service and ensuring every candy purchase brings a smile to our customers' faces. I take pride in sourcing high-quality products to criate marvelose candys and providing a delightful shopping experience. As the store continues to grow, I look forward to expanding the offerings, introducing new flavors, and building lasting relationships with my valued customers.
  Thank you for supporting my small candy store and embark on this exciting journey whit me. Stay tuned for updates and new arrivals by following the on Instagram. I can't wait to make your candy dreams come true!</p>
